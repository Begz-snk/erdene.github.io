            The history of Porsche in the automotive industry is rich with
            innovation, evolution, and motorsports. From its first model to
            modern-day achievements, the automaker has always been at the
            forefront of the car-making world. This innovation has provided the
            groundwork for modern features, technology, and design aesthetics.
            Porsche has pushed the envelope, forcing the competition to follow
            suit, and as a result, has left a mark on the automotive world. By
            identifying needs and predicting trends, Porsche has always stayed
            ahead, inviting other manufacturers to try and keep up. The result:
            a company built on hunting down success and invention. This
            automaker has never just made cars that are more advanced, it's also
            built machines that are crafted around the driving experience. With
            its fair share of roots in the motorsport world, Porsche understands
            what it takes to make a vehicle perform well, under any conditions.

            Every Great Super Hero Has an Origin Story Started by Ferdinand
            Porsche and his son Ferry in 1948, Porsche has developed a
            reputation for engineering excellence and creating some of the
            finest and most capable sports cars in the world. Before starting
            Porsche, Ferdinand worked at Daimler-Benz, and designed the original
            Volkswagen Beetle. Ferry Porsche would take after his father in this
            regard, and he was a major contributor to the creation of the very
            first Porsche: the legendary 356. While Porsche has undoubtedly
            created some of the most terrific road cars in history, the car that
            absolutely defines the brand is the iconic Porsche 911. First shown
            in 1963 and offered for sale in 1964, that car has seen almost
            countless revisions and updates in the fifty-plus years it has
            dominated the road and track. Porsche 911 milestones include, but
            are certainly not limited to, the 911 S in 1967, the first 911 Turbo
            in 1974, and the 911 Cabriolet in 1983, followed closely by the
            first all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 in 1990.

            Currently, Porsche is building some of the most exciting cars.

            From the Track to the Street Besides the 911, the Porsche name is
            synonymous with road racing. There are few manufacturers that can
            hold a candle to what the brand from Stuttgart has accomplished.
            According to Porsche, its cars have won some 24,000 races over the
            years since it began competing. Highlights from this incredible
            resume include over 50 class wins at the iconic Le Mans racetrack in
            France.

            Porsche has always had an incredible commitment to racing, and much
            of that race-inspired engineering makes its way directly into the
            brand’s road cars. Two of the most exciting examples of that racing
            DNA are embodied in the incredible Carrera GT from the early 2000s
            and the most recent 918 Spyder that launched in 2013. While the two
            were wildly different machines, they both represent the absolute
            pinnacle of what the brand is capable of, and they helped set a new
            standard for road-car performance.Porsche has always had an incredible commitment to racing, and much

            The Panamera seems to have taken on the role of test bed for new
            interiors and digital connectivity, which is illustrated by the
            third-generation sedan that Porsche announced today. New engines and
            a new suspension system also make their debuts in the sedan. Three
            variants were unveiled, the Panamera, Panamera 4, and Panamera Turbo
            E-Hybrid, and the former two will start arriving in dealer showrooms
            in spring 2024.
